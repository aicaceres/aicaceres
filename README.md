### Hi there 👋 I´m Alejandra

I'm a Software Engineer, with more than 20 years of experience in software development, involved in the entire life cycle.

Currently, I have resumed my career as a developer by getting certified as a full-stack PERN doing projects in **_React_** with **_Express_** and **_NodeJs_**.

Previously I have worked mainly with **_PHP_** and **_Symfony_** framework and other technologies such as **_HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PostgreSQL_**. 
<br>Throughout my career, I have participated in projects related to areas of debt management, health, tourism, auditing, and business management, among others.

Although I define myself as full-stack, I lean towards the backend because it is where I can bring my strengths in process logic and problem-solving.
